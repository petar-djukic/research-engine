/make-work I want to make sure we are aligned on the design of the Cupboard and Table. Both are interfaces. The Cupboard interface has a method GetTable(name_of_table), which returns the reference to the table. Each Table has the same interface methods Get and Set. There is no method CrumbsTable.Get(). Its Cuboard.GetTable(crumbs).Get(crumb_id). Cupboard interface also has attach/detach methods to connect to the back end. The attach method may take in a json object of configs.
