title: Paper Search
problem: |
  Researchers query academic sources outside the pipeline: open a browser,
  navigate to arXiv or Semantic Scholar, craft a query, scan results, copy
  identifiers, and paste them back into the acquisition stage. Each
  transition loses context: the query that motivated the search, the
  ranking the researcher applied mentally, and the papers that were
  rejected. When exploring a new topic the researcher may repeat this loop
  dozens of times across multiple sources, manually deduplicating results
  that appear in more than one database.

  We need a search stage that accepts a research question or structured
  query, fans it out to multiple academic APIs, deduplicates and ranks
  the combined results, and presents a list of candidate papers with
  enough metadata for the researcher to decide what to acquire. The output
  feeds directly into the acquisition stage so papers flow into the
  pipeline without manual identifier copying.

goals:
  - G1: Provide a single query interface that searches multiple academic sources and returns unified results
  - G2: Support both free-text research questions and structured queries (author, title, keywords, date range)
  - G3: Deduplicate results that appear in more than one source and rank them by relevance
  - G4: Output a list of candidate papers with identifiers and metadata that the acquisition stage can consume directly

requirements:
  R1:
    title: Query Interface
    items:
      - R1.1: Search must accept a free-text research question as a string (e.g. "attention mechanisms in transformer architectures")
      - R1.2: Search must accept structured query parameters including author name, title keywords, abstract keywords, and publication date range
      - R1.3: When both free-text and structured parameters are provided, Search must combine them (structured parameters refine the free-text query)
      - R1.4: Search must accept a maximum results parameter with a default of 20
      - R1.5: Search must return a descriptive error when the query is empty or contains no searchable terms
      - R1.6: Search must accept a --query-file flag that specifies a YAML file path for persisting queries and results

  R2:
    title: Source Backends
    items:
      - R2.1: Search must query the arXiv API (export.arxiv.org) using the provided search terms
      - R2.2: Search must query the Semantic Scholar Academic Graph API using the provided search terms
      - R2.3: Each backend must be independently enabled or disabled via configuration
      - R2.4: Search must return a descriptive error when all configured backends are disabled
      - R2.5: When one backend fails (network error, API error, timeout), Search must log the error and continue with results from remaining backends
      - R2.6: Search must support adding new backends without modifying existing backend code (backend interface pattern)

  R3:
    title: Result Ranking and Deduplication
    items:
      - R3.1: Search must deduplicate results across backends by matching on DOI, arXiv ID, or title similarity (normalized, case-insensitive, ignoring punctuation)
      - R3.2: When duplicates are found, Search must merge metadata from both sources, preferring the source with more complete fields
      - R3.3: Search must rank results by relevance to the query terms
      - R3.4: Search must support a recency bias option that boosts papers published within a configurable time window (default 2 years)
      - R3.5: Each result must include a relevance score between 0.0 and 1.0

  R4:
    title: Output Format
    items:
      - R4.1: Search must return a list of SearchResult records, each containing at minimum an identifier (arXiv ID, DOI, or URL), title, authors, abstract, publication date, source (which backend found it), and relevance score
      - R4.2: Search must print results to stdout in a human-readable table (rank, title truncated to 60 characters, authors, year, source)
      - R4.3: Search must support a --json flag that outputs the full SearchResult list as JSON for programmatic consumption
      - R4.4: Each SearchResult must include a preferred acquisition identifier (arXiv ID if available, then DOI, then URL) so the acquisition stage can consume results without transformation
      - R4.5: Search must print the total number of results and the number of deduplicated items removed
      - R4.6: Search must support a --query-file flag that saves the query parameters, configuration, and results to a YAML file; when the file exists and no query is provided, Search must load and display the saved results without re-querying APIs
      - R4.7: Search must support a --csl flag that outputs results in CSL (Citation Style Language) YAML format with fields id, type, title, author (family/given), abstract, issued (date-parts), and DOI where available

  R5:
    title: Rate Limiting and Access
    items:
      - R5.1: Search must include a configurable delay between API calls to different backends (default 1 second)
      - R5.2: Search must respect the arXiv API rate limit of one request per 3 seconds
      - R5.3: Search must respect the Semantic Scholar API rate limit (100 requests per 5 minutes for unauthenticated access)
      - R5.4: Search must set a User-Agent header identifying the tool (e.g. "research-engine/0.1") on all API requests
      - R5.5: Search must support a Semantic Scholar API key via configuration for higher rate limits
      - R5.6: Search must use a configurable timeout for each API request (default 30 seconds)

non_goals:
  - We do not crawl, mirror, or index the academic literature; we query existing APIs on demand
  - We do not build a local search index or paper database across sessions
  - We do not traverse citation graphs (cited-by, references) as part of search
  - We do not perform full-text search within paper contents; we search metadata and abstracts only
  - We do not handle authentication for paywalled publishers; we search open APIs
acceptance_criteria:
  - Search returns results for a free-text query against arXiv
  - Search returns results for a free-text query against Semantic Scholar
  - Search returns combined, deduplicated results when both backends are enabled
  - Search accepts structured query parameters (author, keywords, date range) and narrows results accordingly
  - Search fails with a descriptive error when the query is empty
  - Search continues and returns partial results when one backend fails
  - Results include identifiers that the acquisition stage can consume directly
  - JSON output flag produces valid JSON with all SearchResult fields
  - Rate limiting delays are applied between API calls
  - Query file saves query and results; loading a query file displays results without re-querying
  - CSL output flag produces valid CSL YAML with author, title, date, and identifier fields
